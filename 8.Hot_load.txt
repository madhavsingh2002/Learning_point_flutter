Hot reload in Flutter is a feature that allows developers to quickly see the results of changes made to the 
source code without restarting the entire application. Here’s a detailed look at the concept:

1. Instant Updates: Hot reload applies code changes to the running application instantly, 
reflecting updates in the UI without needing a full restart.
2. State Preservation: The current state of the application is preserved, 
meaning you don’t lose the state of your app (e.g., the current view or user input) when you make changes.
3. Development Efficiency: Significantly speeds up the development process by reducing the time taken to 
see the effects of code changes.
4. Supported Changes: Works well for most code updates, including adding new features, fixing bugs, and
tweaking UI components. However, some changes (e.g., altering the app’s main entry point) might require 
a full restart.
5. Debugging Aid: Makes it easier to experiment with code, debug issues, and iterate on designs rapidly 
by providing immediate visual feedback.

Hot reload is particularly beneficial for Flutter’s development workflow, enhancing productivity and
allowing for a more interactive and responsive development experience.
