In Flutter, InheritedWidget is a special type of widget that allows data to be passed down the widget tree 
and accessed efficiently by its descendants. It is commonly used for state management and sharing data within 
a portion of the widget tree. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the concept:

1. Data Propagation:
   - Shared Data: InheritedWidget enables sharing of data with descendant widgets without having to pass 
    the data through constructors explicitly.
   - Scoped Access: Only the widgets that need the data will access it, making the data sharing scoped to a 
    part of the widget tree.

2. Immutability:
   - Immutable: The InheritedWidget itself is immutable. When the data it holds changes, a new instance of 
   the InheritedWidget is created, prompting the widget tree to rebuild.

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Efficient Updates: Widgets that depend on an InheritedWidget are rebuilt only when the InheritedWidget 
   changes, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary rebuilds.

4. Using InheritedWidget:
   - Creating a Custom InheritedWidget: Define a class that extends InheritedWidget and includes a method 
   `of` to allow descendants to access the data.
   - Accessing the Data: Descendant widgets can use the `of` method to access the data from the nearest 
   ancestor InheritedWidget of the specified type.

5. Example Use Case:
   - Theme and Localization: Commonly used for sharing theme data, localization strings, or other 
   configurations across the widget tree.

Example Implementation:

class MyInheritedWidget extends InheritedWidget {
  final int myData;

  MyInheritedWidget({Key? key, required this.myData, required Widget child})
      : super(key: key, child: child);

  @override
  bool updateShouldNotify(MyInheritedWidget oldWidget) {
    return myData != oldWidget.myData;
  }

  static MyInheritedWidget? of(BuildContext context) {
    return context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<MyInheritedWidget>();
  }
}

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final inheritedWidget = MyInheritedWidget.of(context);
    return Text('Data: ${inheritedWidget?.myData}');
  }
}

In this example, `MyInheritedWidget` holds some data (`myData`) and provides it to its descendants through the 
`of` method. Widgets down the tree can access this data efficiently, and they will only rebuild when `myData` 
changes. This makes InheritedWidget a powerful tool for managing state and sharing data in Flutter applications.
